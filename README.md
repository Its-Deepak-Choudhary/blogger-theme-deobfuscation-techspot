# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è JavaScript Deobfuscation in Blogger Template

This project documents how I identified and removed a **malicious obfuscated redirect script** from a free Blogger theme (`LearnTechWithDeepak-Free-XML.xml`) that forcefully redirected users to `https://ltwdlearntechwithdeepak.blogspot.com/` when attribution was removed.

---

## üß† Problem Summary

- While customizing the Blogger theme, I noticed a **forced redirect** to a third-party site.
- Even after removing the footer credit (`#probtemplates`), the blog kept redirecting.
- After inspecting the XML, I discovered **obfuscated JavaScript** using `eval`, `_0x` hex variables, and escape sequences (`\x68`, `%6C` etc.).

## üîç Tools Used

### üõ† JavaScript Deobfuscator:
[**de4js** ‚Äì JavaScript Deobfuscator & Unpacker](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/)

## üìú Steps to Decode Obfuscated JavaScript

### 1. **Copy Obfuscated Script**
From the `<script>` block in the theme XML (typically looks like):

```js
<script type='text/javascript'>
//<![CDATA[
eval(function(_0x...) { ... })
//]]>
</script>
````

---

### 2. **Go to De4js Tool**

Open: [https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/)

---

### 3. **Paste Script and Select Settings**

* Choose **Eval** decoding
* Enable:

  * ‚úÖ Format Code
  * ‚úÖ Unescape strings
  * ‚úÖ Recover object path
  * ‚úÖ Merge strings

Then click **"Auto Decode"**

---

### 4. **Analyze Decoded Code**

You'll typically find redirect logic like:

```js
setInterval(function () {
  if (!$('a#probtemplates').length || !$('a#probtemplates:visible').length) {
    window.location.href = 'https://ltwdlearntechwithdeepak.blogspot.com/';
  }
}, 1000);
```

This checks every second if the attribution link is removed ‚Äî and redirects if it is.

---

### 5. **Fix: Remove or Replace the Code**

* Remove the entire `setInterval(...)` block
* Optionally replace the branding with your own:

```js
$('a#probtemplates').attr('href', 'https://yourdomain.com').text('Your Brand');
```

Wrap in CDATA if used in XML:

```xml
<script type='text/javascript'>
<![CDATA[
  // your clean JS here
]]>
</script>
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Result

* Attribution is now fully customizable
* Redirect removed
* Blog works perfectly with custom branding
